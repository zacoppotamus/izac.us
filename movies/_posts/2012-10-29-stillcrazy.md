Rock band mockumentaries are not that many in the history of modern cinema. The genre in itself features an often comic depiction of a band in the form of a documentary and was probably coined by the fantastic This is Spiñal Tap, a film which you must definitely see if you have ever played in a band. Still Crazy portrays Strange Fruit, a band of ageing ’70s rockers who reunite to play the same festival that tore them apart many years ago. To do so however, they must first sort out their egos, battle the personal demons that haunted them for years and find a way to persevere through all the obstructions that come up during their warm-up tour. Still Crazy elegantly wades through ’70s nostalgia and band life on the road. It features a great soundtrack and the ending in particular was magnificent, featuring a song written by Mick Jones (of Foreigner) especially for this movie. 7/10
