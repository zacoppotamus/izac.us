The first half hour or so of the movie was amazing. It fully captured the inner workings and genius of John Nash. I especially liked the scene which shows the inception of the Nash Equilibrium. However the second part dealt in great length with the mathematician’s schizophrenia and that tired me after a while, during the second half of the movie. A Beautiful Mind is a glimpse in the breakdown of Nash and the way he learns to deal with and accept his disease. The sappy ‘love conquers all’ is omnipresent in the later stages (this is Hollywood, after all). I’m not a big fan of Russell Crowe but his performance wasn’t half bad and the screenplay was exceptional (although it omitted and changed many facts from Nash’s biography of the same name). 7/10
