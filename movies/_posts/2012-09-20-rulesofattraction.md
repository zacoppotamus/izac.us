A fictional Liberal Arts College in New Hampshire is the backdrop of this adaptation based on Bret Easton Ellis’ book of the same name. Sex, booze and drugs are the means of escape from the ennui of the rich students, which also fuels a peculiar love triangle. Roger Avary, a co-worker of Tarantino in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, is the director and two scenes in particular embody his innovative touch to the movie; the split-screen sequence featuring James van der Beek (of Dawson’s Creek fame) and Victor’s monologue describing his trip around Europe. Maybe it’s the underlying dark overtones of the protagonists or simply their devil-may-care, bohemian attitudes that attract me so much to them. This film has quickly become one of my favourites and even after repeated viewings hasn’t lost any of its charm. It also introduced me to transgressive fiction, a relatively new genre of fiction featured throughout Ellis’ and Chuck Palahniuk’s works. 9/10.
