Shame is a raw and frantic story of a sex addict struggling to fight his inner addiction, while at the same time  trying to restore his relationship with his sister. Driven by the brilliant performance of Michael Fassbender, it is a film that one might find difficult to watch, given the many explicit sex scenes. Carey Mulligan perfectly adopts the character of Brandon’s (Fassbender) heartbroken sister who seeks love from her boyfriend and affection and understanding from her brother.  The plot basis of Shame isn’t exceptional on its own but when it is combined with the emotional suffering and pain of its lead actors it makes for a pretty thrilling watch. Except from the acting, what makes the film memorable is the atmospheric and dark tone that is set by director Steve McQueen who seems to be growing into a new force of modern cinema (check out his other full-length film “Hunger”). 9/10
