I saw this with some buddies at the theater and, surprisingly, it was the first time I saw a Woody Allen film at the theater, even though I greatly admire his work. This is essentially a collection of four separate stories set in Rome, each dealing with romantic misadventures and comic escapades. However, none of them are particularly interesting or engaging and that’s a shame because the movie features an all-star cast and great photography and direction, along with appropriate locations to showcase the city’s beauty. In To Rome With Love, Allen doesn’t ‘make love to the city’ as was suggested in Midnight in Paris and frankly, it left me feeling unsatisfied. That said, a Woody Allen film is better than none and I can’t wait for his next one. 6/10.
