Meddling between being a bittersweet romance and a light drama, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the best films I’ve seen lately. While the proceedings may not be clear while watching the movie, everything is explained at the (not so Hollywood) ending. The screenplay and direction is fantastic and the acting is amazing. 8/10.
