I can only recall few instances where I watched a movie as complex and enigmatic as this at the cinema. This is what one would usually find in a dusty corner at the back of his local video club, but director Paul Thomas Anderson assembled a first-rate cast and targeted a mainstream audience with this film. The Master is set in the post-World War II era, where veteran Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) tries to conform and adjust to the alienating for him standards of modern society. Suffering from post-traumatic stress and alcoholism he can only find a fitting environment under the wings of The Cause’s charismatic leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman). It’s not difficult to see the similarities between The Cause and Scientology, and even notice a subtle jab at the latter. What makes the film memorable though is the stand-out performances and the original score composed by Radiohead’s guitarist Jonny Greenwood (whose music is becoming a steady feature in Anderson’s movies). All in all a cinematic experience that’s hard to forget. 8/10
