As is indicated by the narrator in the beginning of the film this is a classic boy-meets girl story. Here however, director Marc Webb not only perfectly captures the contemporary romantic sensibility but also provides a witty-dialogued and well-acted comedy. Tom is a romantic young man overwhelmed by Morrisey’s bleak and gloomy tales of love, who believes in the notion of true love. On the other hand, Summer is Tom’s boss’ cynical kitten-cute, blue eyed assistant  who believes that it is merely a fantasy for the benefit of songwriters and poets. The film is a narrative of the 500-day relationship between the two presented out of order, going back and forth and visiting the ups and downs of their love affair. I’m not sure if the film’s ending was optimistic, it left me with a bittersweet feeling. Nevertheless (500) Days of Summer is an almost flawless romantic comedy that stands out as one of the best in its genre. 9/10
