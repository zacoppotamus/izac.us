I first saw High Fidelity 6 years ago, and to tell you the truth it didn’t do much for me. But now, upon second watching I can understand a bit more where the story is coming from. Being stuck in a boring life, afraid to get out of your comfort zone, while at the same time battling with demons of the past, correcting mistakes, coming to terms with gone regrets.   Nick Hornby’s books are usually about ordinary people leading ordinary lives and this is the case as well in High Fidelity. The underlying theme may be lists. Top ten albums, top five breakups, all leading to memories and in turn a catharsis which will set Gordon (Cusack) free from his past and ready for the road ahead. I immensely enjoyed the music, the comic relief (Jack Black is the man) and the generally easy-going atmosphere of the film. Not bad at all. 7/10.
