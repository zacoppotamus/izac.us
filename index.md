Welcome
===

Hey, I'm Zac, currently 20, located in New York. I've always been interested in things that blended technical and creative aspects. For this reason, things that excite me and that I enjoy working on include big data, creative coding, and data visualization. I'm an avid movie and photography fan. I listen to, play and write about music. In my spare time I study Computer Science at the University of Bristol.
