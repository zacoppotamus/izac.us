Welcome
===

Hey, I'm Zac, currently 21, located in New York. I'm a CS major, in my third year, studying at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm passionate about data and interactive storytelling. In that context, I love looking beyond the surface for meanings and making use of progressive technologies as a means of communicating it to a widespread audience in the most efficient manner. Furthermore, creative applications that reside in the intersection of technology and art fascinate me.
In my spare time, I enjoy programming generative artworks and exploring alternative methods of interfacing users' actions with software. Feel free to <a href="mailto:me@izac.us">contact me</a> or take a look at my <a href="resume.pdf">résumé</a>.
